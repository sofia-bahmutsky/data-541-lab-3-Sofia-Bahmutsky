# Embedding Images in GitHub Markdown

GitHub Markdown has several options for embedding images. One of the most straightforward is using Markdown version of the image embed:

![UBC Okanagan](./5NarrowLogo_ex_768.png "UBCO")

Alternatively, you may use the HTML ```<img>``` tag instead. This can give you greater control over sizing of your image:

With 25% width:



<img src="/5NarrowLogo_ex_768.png" width="25%" alt="UBCO MDS 2018" title="UBCO">



With 100% width:



<img src="/5NarrowLogo_ex_768.png" width="100%" alt="UBCO MDS 2018" title="UBCO">

By combining Markdown and HTML, you can get the simplicity of Markdown styling and the power of HTML styling in the same document.
