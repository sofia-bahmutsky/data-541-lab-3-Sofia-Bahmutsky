# An example of Markdown

## The Simplicity of Markdown

The Markdown syntax is a way of **structuring** documents and providing styling without having to use HTML or Cascading Style Sheets. The name is a play on the term *markup*, which is the process of preparing documents for printing through the process of editing and layout.

## Features of GitHub Markdown

## A Friendly reminder

> Remember, some components in Markdown require spaces between text and symbols, such as headers and tables. For example, # **Header**, not #**Header**!
